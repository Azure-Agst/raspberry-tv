# [DEPRECIATED] raspberry-tv

project was cancelled, due to someone else commandeering the job

basically programming a node.js app to host a webserver.

- one page hosts the view, which loops the pictures
- the other is a management page

```
$ git clone http://github.com/Azure-Agst/raspberry-tv.git
$ npm install
$ node start.js
```
